Each pair of files

   name.azm name.ozm

demonstrates one or more concepts from the zoem language.
Basic processing for file 'name.azm'

   zoem -i name

results in the output file 'name.ozm'.  Some files need additional processing
flags, these are indicated below and can be found in the Makefile as well.

The file fib.azm demonstrates how to include input interactively,
so there is no matching 'fib.ozm' file.

The file stress.azm contains a large set of error tests from which zoem must be
able to recover fully - it should in general recover from almost any
conceivable error. In stress.azm this is done via \catch{error}{.. erroneous
stuf ..}. In interactive mode, zoem will recover from errors without any help.
Zoem can enter interactive mode upon errors in regular file processing
via the -x option.



DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
catch.azm                  nested while{1}{...} stopped by throwing exception.
fib.azm                      prompting and inclusion via STDIN, while{} stuff.
loop.azm                                             nested apply invocations.
meta.azm                                zoem 'closure' mechanism of some sort.
nest.azm                  anon/nesting/delay arithmetic, not very instructive.
power-of-2.azm                       computing 2*k by recursion and file size.
reverse.azm                           how to revert (nested!) lists with zoem.
scope.azm                          basic illustration of push/pop name scopes.
special.azm                      silly illustration of filtering capabilities.
stress.azm                                        extensive stress test suite.
tr.azm                           some translate options, not very interesting.
txt-table.azm                                        text formatting examples. 
xml.azm                                          *ML syntactic sugar examples.
