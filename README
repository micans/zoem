   Zoem is an interpreter for an interpretive language which is called,
   as things go, zoem. From the Zoem User Manual:

   Zoem is an interpretive macro language with substantial facilities for
   programming. It supports a two-stage process, consisting of macro
   interpretation (featuring inside-out evaluation if needed), followed by a
   simple and powerful application of stream character filtering.

   Its syntax is remindful of \it{TeX}'s, it has dictionary stacks like
   \it{PostScript}, and various resemblances to \it{m4} and \it{info}.  It
   has interfaces to modules making life easy \- counters, references,
   arithmetic, multi-dimensional data storage, input/output operations,
   regular expressions, and system commands.

   Zoem is used for creating extendible dummy mark-up languages and mapping
   those to real mark-up languages.  The dummy languages have all the power
   of the zoem primitives available to them.  A prime application is the
   creation of little mark-up languages that allow easy preparation of
   documents for use with different devices.  Examples are the PUD \bf{faq}
   language and the PUD \bf{man} language, both of which can be used to
   generate troff output and html output. PUD stands for Portable Unix
   Documentation and is shipped with Aephea.  Aephea itself is an
   abstraction layer for creating concise and maintainable HTML documents.

   The version tag, which is of the form dd-ddd, encodes the year and
   day in year in which the distribution was made. So 02-058 encodes the
   58-th day of the year 2002.
